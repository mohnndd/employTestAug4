Develop an generic API container :

•             that will accept a fixed JSON or REST API response ( 100 attributes 1 to 100) and provide a fixed json output ( 1 to 100)

•             The JSON / REST  will have authentication and header which will identify the following
o             Target database on which the API will call
o             Stored procedure ID which should be called

•             The API will refer to a database table which will contain rows of records
o             Stored procedure ID
o             Actual stored procedure
o             Target DB
o             Database connection string for the target DB
o             Input Attribute 1 to 100 mapping to Stored Procedure

•             The Api on run time will do the following
o             Receive incoming JSON / REST
o             Parse the input
o             Refer to the table look up the correct stored procedure to be run
o             Pass the data to the db thru db connection and execute the stored procedure
o             Provide the results back to the calling program
o             Store a log of the API call with start time and end time of the event.

Question: 
Config file or just connection String?
.Env?
Rest controller?
deploy over AWS with RDS? or just princple code on Github enough? 
print screen for result? 
Postman collection? -

questions: 

- position? related to business app, core app, commericals, services, onboarding? 
- single API webapp deployment or Micro-services archtiecrue
- mission critical app, (require DR and fail-over configration, replication relation) 
- what technology?
- deployment on VM or didicated, on-local or co-location?
- SSL, wildcard vendor or local?
- agnistoc of speifice? 
- development or operation?
- require integration with Active Directory for SSO or you guys use another technology? what MFA used in your infrastracture.
- number of integration entity and points.
- is there any items related to maturity level and compliance.
